# Usability Testing of OutWrite Magazine Website

### DH150 Assignment02: Usability Testing by Naomi Deng

### Introduction: 

- The primary purpose of conducting this usability testing is to learn how easy or difficult it is for new users or recurrent users to use the OutWrite Magazine website. According to the heuristic evaluation, I recognized the three most important usability issues that need timely solutions. First of all, the lack of about page on the website confuses first-time users, especially those who do not have prior knowledge about what to expect through using the website. Moreover, the hidden search bar proposes problems regarding convenience and efficiency, specifically for users who have a clear target of what they are looking for. Finally, the variety of sections and divisions on the website could pose difficulties for users to navigate information and resources. Thus, I formulated three tasks related to these three main issues separately to examine whether these existing problems initiate obstacles and affect the user’s overall experience of using the OutWrite Magazine website. Expressly: 1. Whether the missing about page bother first-time users who intend to learn more about the magazine/organization and thus affect their willingness to use the website; 2. Whether the hidden search bar prevents the users to find the information they need and thus affect their efficiency; 3. Whether the variety of categories and sections cause obstacles for users to navigate information. I created an online questionnaire that consists of six sections - Orientation script, Informed consent form, Pre-test questionnaire, Three tasks, Post-test questionnaire (SUS), Demographic questions. The participant was asked to fill in with honest evaluations and answers while she was using the website. In addition to the questionnaire, I also recorded the usability testing process for reviewing the users’ facial expressions and body languages to better review and analyze data. The overall goal is to identify usability problems, acquire and collect qualitative data, evaluate the participant's satisfaction with the website and develop strategies to improve user experience in the future.
